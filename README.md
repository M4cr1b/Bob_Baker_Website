## Configuration

### n8n Webhook URLs
The website integrates with n8n for order processing. Configure these in `script.js`:

```javascript
// Order submission webhook
const N8N_ORDER_WEBHOOK = "https://n8n.srv1191414.hstgr.cloud/webhook-test/55790ae9-4c5f-4073-87c5-593b5d2364ed";

// Admin data retrieval webhook
const N8N_ADMIN_DATA_WEBHOOK = "https://n8n.srv1191414.hstgr.cloud/webhook-test/94ee3ade-06c5-4973-b56d-a09876a722ef";
```

**To update webhook URLs:**
1. Open `script.js`
2. Find the `N8N_ORDER_WEBHOOK` and `N8N_ADMIN_DATA_WEBHOOK` constants
3. Replace with your n8n webhook URLs

### Admin Credentials
**⚠️ SECURITY WARNING**: Change the default admin password before deploying to production!

To change credentials, edit `script.js`:
```javascript
const ADMIN_USER = "BobBakerWins";  // Change username
const ADMIN_PASS = "Abundance123";  // Change password
```

### Products
Products are defined in `script.js`. To add or modify products:

1. Open `script.js`
2. Find the `products` array
3. Add/modify product objects:
```javascript
{
    id: 5,
    name: "New Product Name",
    price: 25.00,
    image: "https://image-url-here"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Orders Not Submitting
- **Check n8n webhook URL**: Verify the `N8N_ORDER_WEBHOOK` in `script.js` is correct
- **Check browser console**: Open Developer Tools (F12) and look for error messages
- **Verify internet connection**: Orders require connection to n8n server
- **Check required fields**: Ensure name, phone, and payment method are filled

### Admin Dashboard Not Loading Orders
- **Click "Refresh Data"**: Orders don't auto-load on first visit
- **Check n8n webhook**: Verify `N8N_ADMIN_DATA_WEBHOOK` is correct
- **Check browser console**: Look for fetch errors
- **Verify n8n workflow**: Ensure your n8n workflow returns JSON array format

### Cart Not Persisting
- Cart data is stored in browser's localStorage
- Clearing browser data will reset the cart
- Cart persists across page navigation within the same browser session

### Login Not Working
- Verify credentials match exactly (case-sensitive):
  - Username: `BobBakerWins`
  - Password: `Abundance123`
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure `script.js` is loaded properly

### Images Not Loading
- Images are loaded from Unsplash (external CDN)
- Requires internet connection
- If images fail, check internet connectivity

### Styling Issues
- Ensure `style.css` is in the same directory
- Check that Font Awesome CDN is accessible
- Clear browser cache and reload
